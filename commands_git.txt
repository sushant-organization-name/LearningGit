# Git Learnings and Basics
1. Git:		Decentralized and Distributed version control system. Open Source providing a community, Fast, Integration with other servers and tools.

2. Repository:	Collection of Files Managed by Git. Quasi hidden .git folder inside your repo. Working Directory or Workspace. One Project shoud have
				one repo.
				
3. Commits:		Snapshots of your work are stored via commits. Stored on branches (master | @xyz_branch). Changes are made to files!

4. Github:	Git project itself is stored in Github. Open Source version control system with Github having some extra features such as Issue Tracking, Web Pages
			etc.

# Setting up your global configurations like name and email address!
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
git config --global user.email "Your Email Address"

# To check if global config are set 
git config --list

# For more help
git config --help 

# Set up to use notepad in Gitbash
notepad++ ~/.bash_profile
alias npp='notepad++ --multiInst -nosession'
git config --global core.editor "notepad++ -multiInst -nosession"

# Check if notepad works!
git config --global -e

#TODO: Set up P4Merge as Merge and Diff Tool.

# Initializing an empty git repository in your local desktop

# Navigate to the folder > Create a new directory where you want to manage your code > Navigate to the newly created directory
cd C:\Learnings
mkdir GitProjects
cd GitProjects/

# git init command creates a folder with git initiated in it > Navigate to the folder > ls -al will list all folders available in the folder 
git init demo
cd demo/

# You will see .git folder initiated here
ls -al

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Local Git States
1. Working Directory > Contains the location where you are working on the files locally
2. Staging Directory > is the location where the files are prepared to make them move to the next stage
3. Repository(.git folder) > Files that are commited and saved to the git repository

# Remote Git State(s)
1. Remote > this is the combination of all the states(mentioned in above local) and is the public git repository.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# First Commit

***** WORKING_DIRECTORY *****

# check out whats the status of the git repo
git status

# Create some file and add some text, say README.md

# Check the status now. 
git status 

***** STAGING_DIRECTORY *****
# add the untracked file from your working directory to staging area
git add README.md 

***** LOCAL_REPOSITORY *****
# commits the changes/files from your staging area to the Repository(.git folder) locally in your branch.
git commit -m "Git Commands v1"

# nothing to commit and work tree is clean
git status 


NOTE: Actual git repository is contained in .git folder. This is a special directory managed by GIT internally!
Delete this .git folder and you will no longer be in the version control and it will be a normal folder that can not be version controlled!

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Started with Existing Project 

# Navigate to a project what you want to push to Git. Once you are at the location, perform below command!
git init . 
git add . 
git commit -m "Your message"

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Git History

# gives you an idea on your commit history
git log

# gives you an idea on your commit history but shows the log message and textual difference. Presents merge commands in git diff-tree --cc format
git show 

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Express Commits

# Check what files are being tracked by git
git ls-files 

# Add tracked/modified files to the staging area and then push it to the repository git local
git commit -am "Adding Modified Files directly and commiting it (skip add step)"

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Backing Out Changes after add/commit from Staging/Repository(.git local)

# unstage the changes (after git add ) command. This will only unstage your changes from Staging Area, but your changes will be displayed as it is in Working directory 
git reset HEAD FILE_NAME

# To change the files as per the last commit in your Repository.git folder
git checkout -- FILE_NAME
