Github UI has a button to fork.

# Synchronize the Changes from your upstream repo to the origin remote 

# Get all the remotes - git clone will automatically create an origin remote for you
git remote -v

# Add a Remote - upstream is the name here similar to origin
git remote add upstream git_url_from_where_the_project_was_forked

# Synchronize changes from the forked url to the remote url
git pull upstream branch_name(master)
