# GitHub Create a new Branch

You will be on master branch by default on github. In order to create a new branch, in the branch dropdown, write the name of the
new branch that you want to create. 

Once done, you will find a new branch that is listed in the dropdown and github automatically changes your branch from master 
to example.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------			

# Create branch locally
git checkout -b branch_name

# remove a file
git rm file_name.txt
git status

# push the newly created branch to github
git push -u remote_name(origin) branch_name 

	-u sets up the tracking relationship between the local and remote branch. 
	
# push and pull without specifying the name of the branch as you have set up the tracking relationship earlier
git push 
git pull
